| Word | [Word](https://github.com/mortenhansenDK/M365CopilotHomework/blob/main/Word/readME.md) | In this lab, you'll create a Copilot agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat with Microsoft Copilot Studio agent builder. This agent will be designed to assist users with questions about Copilot agents. The agent will act as a learning companion or teacher, grounded in official Microsoft documentation. |
| PowerPoint | [PowerPoint](https://github.com/mortenhansenDK/M365CopilotHomework/blob/main/PowerPoint/readME.md) | In this lab, you'll create a SharePoint-integrated AI assistant using Microsoft Copilot Studio agent builder. Designed to support sales operations, the agent can analyze Excel data from SharePoint, reference policy documents, and deliver insights through dynamic charts and images. Leveraging advanced capabilities like code interpreter and image generation, the Sales Admin Assistant transforms static content into interactive, intelligent responsesâ€”making sales trend tracking and policy compliance faster and easier. |
| Set yourself up for success & discover ALM best practices | [setup-for-success](./labs/setup-for-success) | Set yourself up for success by learning ALM best practices in Microsoft Copilot Studioâ€”because building great agents isn't enough if you can't deploy, update, or collaborate with confidence. This lab shows you how to avoid common pitfalls like manual rework, overwritten changes, and fragile deployments by structuring your solutions, managing configurations, and enabling Git-based source control from the start. |
| Give your public website chatbot a brain and make it an agent | [public-website-agent](./labs/public-website-agent) | Learn how to build and publish a Copilot Studio agent that delivers rich, contextual answers by combining your content with real-time dataâ€”no coding required.

| Create an MBR Agent and Deploy to SharePoint | [mbr-prep-sharepoint-agent](./labs/mbr-prep-sharepoint-agent) | In this lab, you'll build a conversational MBR (Monthly Business Review) agent using Microsoft Copilot Studio and SharePoint. The agent streamlines MBR preparation by extracting key insights, surfacing trends, and answering questions directly from uploaded decksâ€”helping leaders focus on strategy instead of manual review. You'll configure knowledge sources, test the agent, and deploy it to SharePoint for easy access by your team. |
| Create an 'Ask me anything' agent for your employees | [ask-me-anything](./labs/ask-me-anything) | In this hands-on lab, you'll build a multi-agent IT Support solution using Microsoft Copilot Studio. Your primary "Ask me anything" agent will intelligently route queries to specialized sub-agentsâ€”like one for ServiceNow knowledge and incidentsâ€”delivering fast, accurate answers across systems like SharePoint, ServiceNow, and custom sources. You'll configure contextual routing, deploy into Microsoft 365 Copilot, and streamline workflows with AI-driven analysis and human-in-the-loop review. |
| Create an autonomous support agent and unlock new levels of productivity with AI automation | [autonomous-support-agent](./labs/autonomous-support-agent) | Create an intelligent autonomous support agent that automatically responds to user emails, retrieves real-time ticket updates from ServiceNow, and answers questions using your knowledge baseâ€”all without human intervention.

It then compiles curated summaries into a structured HTML report and sends it via Microsoft 365 Outlookâ€”all without user interaction. By the end of the 60-minute lab, participants will have configured triggers, tools, topics, variables, and report templates to create a fully operational, proactive assistant that enhances account intelligence and helps sales teams stay ahead of key developments. |
| Source control and deploy your agents | [pipelines-and-source-control](./labs/pipelines-and-source-control) | Deploy Copilot Studio agents with confidence using Power Platform pipelines. In this hands-on lab, you'll learn how to automate and govern your deployment process across DEV, TEST, and PROD environments. From creating robust pipelines to handling post-deployment configuration and source control, you'll gain practical skills to implement repeatable ALM workflows with built-in validation, managed environments, and Git integrationâ€”ensuring every deployment is consistent, secure, and production-ready. |
| Copilot Studio Kit | [copilot-studio-kit](./labs/copilot-studio-kit) | Automate quality assurance for your Copilot Studio agents with the Copilot Studio Kit. In this lab, you'll configure and run automated test scenarios, validate agent behavior using multiple test types, and gain actionable insights through analytics.
